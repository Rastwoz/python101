#python can do all basic arithemetic

#add with the + symbol
x = 1+1

#subtract with the - symbol
y = 1-1

#multiply with the * symbol
z = 1*10

#divide with the / symbol
a = 10/5

#power with **
b = 3**3


#in place operators allow you to asssign a value and perform arithmetic in one step
c =  5
c += 2

#operations between floats and integers will always return a float
mix  = 3.0 + 2

#python follows PEMDAs for order of operations
expression= 3*2+(10-5)

print(x,y,z, a,b,c, mix, expression, sep = "\n")
