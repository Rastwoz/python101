#variables are containers for storing variables

x = 5
name = "Mary"

print(x)
print(name)


#Unlike other programming languages, you do not need to declare variable types in Python and are able to change variable types

#reassigning value of x from number 5 to string "Violin"
x = "Violin"
print(x)
